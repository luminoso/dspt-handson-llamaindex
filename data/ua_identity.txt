UA’s Identity
The image of a brand is one of its greatest assets, and it is through it and the set of elements that form it, explicit or implicit, that the brand is immediately recognized. Thus, the studying of the brand, through the correct use of explicit elements such as color, font, the correct proportions of the logo, is fundamental to adequately transmit the implicit elements, which are the intrinsic values of the brand.

University of Aveiro
Created in 1976 by architect Firmino Trabulo, the original signature of the University of Aveiro incorporates several symbols (a griffon, a book, the armillary sphere, and the Greek words “theoria”, “poiesis”, “praxis”) that personify the importance that the University of Aveiro has attributed, since its foundation, to the connection to the region; to the defense of wisdom, in the teaching and research aspects; to the universality of knowledge; and to the various aspects of theoretical, technological, artistic and humanistic creation and research.

Redesigned in 2003 by designer Francisco Providência, the current graphic signature of the University of Aveiro is the result of the consolidation of the profile of the set of these symbols, giving the whole an evident and robust graphic unit.

ECIU University
Through a cohesive brand and a precise and strong image, the visual identity of the ECIU University, an initiative of the European Consortium of Innovative Universities (ECIU), of which UA is a founding member, reflects the entrepreneurial spirit, energy, innovation, timelessness and dynamism of this new, modern and unconventional university. The contrasting shape, diagonal design, the use of dark blue and yellow, and the typography used, imprint the logo with balance and sophistication, communicate a determination for growth, cooperation and innovation, and emphasize the connection.

The use of a simple structure allows this graphic element to be used in various contexts dynamically, giving the visual identity a universal character.
