       "\"The 1990s marked a new phase in the UA's evolution. New priorities such as internationalisation and cooperation are redefined, namely through participation in European programmes, strengthening relations with Portuguese-speaking and Latin American countries, participating in networks and consortia of international universities and signing protocols with institutions,organisations and companies in Portugal and abroad.\\n\\nThe collaboration of Aveiro University with the local community and society as as whole is reinforced by the UA's engagement in promoting the transfer of knowledge, technology and innovation within the world of business. At the same time, decisive steps are being taken to promote continuous training and distance learning programmes, which were becoming increasingly important in meeting the educational needs of different publics. In the course of its growth, the University has always striven to provide students and lecturers with excellent working spaces, scientific infrastructures and teaching conditions.\\n\\nDuring the second mandate of the fourth rector, Júlio Pedrosa, the academic population exceeded 8000 students and research had attained high quality standards. The dynamism of the University's teaching staff and its researchers would result in the UA becoming the Portuguese University with the largest number of internationally recognised research projects, a characteristic that it still maintains today.\\n\\nThe first mandate of the sixth rector of the UA, Maria Helena Nazaré, was marked by the launch of the UA's teaching programme and technical and professional training programmes (in the academic year 2002/2003). Since then, not only has the UA Post-Secondary Education Programme been extended to other municipalities, but the range of Technological Specialization Courses (CETs) has also increased, and now professional higher technical courses (TESP) are also being offered.\\n\\nThe two mandates of the seventh rector of the UA, Manuel António Assunção, between 2010-2014 and 2014-2018, are marked by a commitment to a Thinking, Feeling Campus and to the consolidation of the UA concept, as well as its affirmation as an international benchmark.\\n\\nOn March 13, 2018, Paulo Jorge Ferreira was elected rector of the UA.\""

In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.\\n\\nI didn\\'t see a way out of this situation. I didn\\'t want to drop out of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he\\'d found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.\\n\\nThen one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I didn\\'t have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so. I\\'ll give you something to read in a few days.\"\\n\\nI picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There\\'s a whole world there that\\'s barely been explored. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.\\n\\nMeanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good.

In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.\\n\\nI didn\\'t see a way out of this situation. I didn\\'t want to drop out of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he\\'d found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.\\n\\nThen one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I didn\\'t have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so. I\\'ll give you something to read in a few days.\"\\n\\nI picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There\\'s a whole world there that\\'s barely been explored.
